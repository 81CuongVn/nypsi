# commands

## multi-user

every punishment command (`$warn`, `$mute`, `$kick`, etc.) allows you to affect multiple users with one command use. to be
able to affect multiple users, each user must be mentioned, otherwise it will not work.

the example below shows how you would mute 3 members for the same length and reason

```
$mute @member1 @member2 @member3 3h spamming
```

member1, member2 and member3 will each be muted for 3 hours, with the reason of spamming.

## targetting users

to target a user, you can either tag them, use their user ID, or their username and tag (username#tag). only mentions are
supported for targetting multiple users at a time.

## unban

in some cases, you can use the user's username to unban a member, although this shouldn't be counted on, as it depends on the
user still being cached by nypsi. if the username does not work, you must use the user's ID.
