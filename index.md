## FAQ

### my server does not qualify for the pings command

there are requirements set for pings/mentioned to be tracked, 
as there is massive performance issues when nypsi tracks every mention on every server, no matter how much they use nypsi.<br />
the requirements are as follows:
 - your server must have less than 150k members
 - your server owner must have an economy profile
the quick fix for this is to simply check the server owner's balance, if you need further help, feel free to join the [support server](https://discord.gg/hJTDNST)
