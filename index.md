## FAQ

### my server does not qualify for the pings command

there are requirements set for pings/mentioned to be tracked,
as there is massive performance issues when nypsi tracks every mention on every server, no matter how much they use nypsi.<br />

the requirements are as follows:

-   your server **must** have less than 150k members
-   your server owner must have an economy profile

the quick fix for this is to simply check the server owner's balance using the `$bal` command, if you need further help, feel free to join the [support server](https://discord.gg/hJTDNST)

### when will karmashop be open

the karmashop (`$karmashop`) opens around once every month. everyone will be notified in the official nypsi server (`$support`) when it is opened.

### how do i disable certain commands

in order to disable a command, run the command below.
```
$disablecmd + <cmd>
```
to undo, type the following command:
```
$disablecmd - <cmd>
```

### whats with the lowercase?

i (max), personally love how lowercase text looks. which is why nypsi is almost entirely lowercase (no this will not change u loser). it also gives a bit of a 
unique aesthetic to nypsi.
